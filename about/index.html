        <h1 id="full-stack-engineer">Full Stack Engineer</h1>

<p>My careers started at 2005 as a full stack software engineer.</p>

<p>How full stack?</p>

<p>Well, my Front End starts from driving a car to the customer gathering requirements, doing a demo, then onto re-styling the UI with CSS, coding Java applet and javascript, html etc.</p>

<p>Back Ends start with J2EE to Database, then onto upgrade, support, and also taking backup of the system onto tapes and store in a safe vault.</p>

<p>As you can see, I’ve gained a lot of involvement on keeping a software company running, and I quite enjoyed it as I like exploring.</p>

<h1 id="consulting-lead">Consulting Lead</h1>

<p>After 10 years of work focusing more on the developing side, I decided to explore my other side on people facing.</p>

<p>Because I realized no matter how advance the technology or fancy tools we are using, they won’t show their value or making profit if they are not directly helping people solve their current problem.</p>

<p>Figuring out the current problem that a customer has, providing professional solution and implementation, eventually delivering values to a customer, this is quite a rewarding experience for a techincal person, and there are the key reasons driving me entering my next career as a consultant.</p>

<p>The transition from a software engineer to a consultant, a senior consultant and then a Consulting Lead took about three years which is quite fast and showing this actully fits me.</p>

<p>I’m grateful I’ve been on this journey because the benefit of a consultant work is I have a lot of opportunities to work with a large variety of people.</p>

<p>I’ve both led teams and being led, I’ve been in good projects and tough ones, I’ve been educating and also debating.</p>

<p>In this consultant journey, I’ve got a lot of feedback from different direction which help me find self-awareness more clearly.</p>

<h1 id="scrum-master">Scrum Master</h1>

<p>In my role as a consulting lead, I’ve led several projects with talented developers.</p>

<p>To me, scrum is an art to give a challenge to a small group of motivated developers, let them drive the process and facilitate them when needed.</p>

<p>Wearing the hat of scrum master, I’m more like a teacher and coach on sticking to the practice, and need to have the knowledge and courage to push back on any external pressure.</p>

<h1 id="career-coach">Career Coach</h1>

<p>As I mentioned, I like exploring, So when I was offered an additional hat to be a people manager and overseeing a pod of developers, I didn’t hesitate at all.</p>

<p>I wanted to build a constant growing and learning environment for all my developers, providing instant feedback to faciliate their self-awareness which is key to their growth.</p>

<p>I’ve also hosted several study groups on Scrum Master and Clean Coder etc.</p>

<p>And I’m really proud that many developers who paticipated in these study groups have been ceritified as Scrum Master as well.</p>

<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>During my journey of exploring, I’m trying to find the purpose of what I’m doing.</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, good technology doesn’t provide any value if it’s not helping people, similarly being a strong and capble professional is not enough to make my life meaningful.</p>

<p>My self-awareness through all my professional life has convinced me what I like most is to provide good leadership, impact, and help to others.</p>

<p>It’s quite rewarding when people came to me and expressed they’ve learned, benefited because of these work I’ve done.</p>

<p>I probably will end this long “about me” article with a message I received from a previous colleague when I left my previous company.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I first joined the company out of college, you were the first lead developer I’d ever worked with. I was a total newbie, and you showed me the ropes with a politeness, sense of empathy and friendliness that I’ve rarely come across throughout my career. You really helped me when I started and for that, I truly am grateful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I probably have’t spoken to him around two years prior to this message because we were on different projects.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, it was a total surprise but reassuring in my heart, convincing me again of who I have been,  can be and want to be.</p>
